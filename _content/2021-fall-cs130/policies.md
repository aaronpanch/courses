# Policies

Since this is a *class*, there are policies that will apply to us. I say *us*, because it includes me.

## Screens

Phones, laptops, tablets, and any other screens aren't allowed during lectures, discussions, or activities that *don't directly involve* using them.  Content will be posted and distributed so note taking isn't neededâ€”if you must take notes, we can come up with a plan.  This class does involve programming (and lots of it) but for the moments where we aren't programming, let's appreciate the "analog" time appropriately.  Of course, during breaks and free time you may use a screen, but try to go outside!

## Food

We're adults (and learning sometimes to be more adult).  If you need to eat, eat. That being said, if it's a distraction or disruption, you will be asked to make a change.

## Academic Accommodations

Students who have been diagnosed with a disability (learning, physical/medical, or psychological) are strongly encouraged to contact the Disability Services office as early as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations for this course. Formal accommodations will only be granted for students whose
disabilities have been verified by the Disability Services office. These accommodations may be necessary
to ensure your full participation and the successful completion of this course. For more information, visit the [Disability Services Website](http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/disability).
