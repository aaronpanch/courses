# Policies

Since this is a *class*, there are policies that will apply to us. I say *us*, because it includes me.

## Screens

Phones, laptops, tablets, and any other screens aren't allowed during lectures, discussions, or activities that *don't directly involve* using them.  Content will be posted and distributed so note taking isn't neededâ€”if you must take notes, we can come up with a plan.  This class does involve programming (and lots of it) but for the moments where we aren't programming, let's appreciate the "analog" time appropriately.  Of course, during breaks and free time you may use a screen, but try to go outside!

## Food

We're adults (and learning to be adults).  If you need to eat, eat. That being said, if it's a distraction or disruption, you will be asked to make a change.
