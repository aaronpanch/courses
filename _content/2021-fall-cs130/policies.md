# Policies

Since this is a _class_, there are policies that will apply to us. I say _us_, because it includes me.

## Screens

Phones, laptops, tablets, and any other screens aren't allowed during lectures, discussions, or activities that _don't directly involve_ using them. Content will be posted and distributed so note taking isn't neededâ€”if you must take notes, we can come up with a plan. This class does involve programming (and lots of it) but for the moments where we aren't programming, let's appreciate the "analog" time appropriately. Of course, during breaks and free time you may use a screen, but try to go outside!

## Food

We're adults (and learning sometimes to be more adult). If you need to eat, eat. That being said, if it's a distraction or disruption, you will be asked to make a change.

## Academic Honesty

To quote another professor's syllabus[^1],

> Learning communities function best when students have academic integrity.

Therefore, dishonesty of any kind (not limited to cheating, or plagiarism) are not tolerated. The nature of programming is _very_ collaborative and often involves using others' source code as a library, adapting a snippet to solve a particular problem, or working with a peer or a partner on group related activities. This is not only encouraged but is helpful! However, merely copying work without attribution or acknowledgement is dishonest (such a definition isn't comprehensive, but is offered as an example). Repeated offenses will be reported to the Provost, and may result in an F grade. Please familiarize yourself with the policies on [academic integrity](https://www.westmont.edu/office-provost/academic-program/academic-integrity-policy)

## Academic Accommodations

Students who have been diagnosed with a disability (learning, physical/medical, or psychological) are strongly encouraged to contact the Disability Services office as early as possible to discuss appropriate accommodations for this course. Formal accommodations will only be granted for students whose
disabilities have been verified by the Disability Services office. These accommodations may be necessary
to ensure your full participation and the successful completion of this course. For more information, visit the [Disability Services Website](http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/disability).
