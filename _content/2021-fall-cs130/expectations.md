# Expectations & Tips for Success

In addition to our "traditional" syllabus, I wanted to include some expectations and tips for success. The following is a bulleted list (not necessarily in order) that itemizes some important things to keep in mind for our semester:

- Ask questions! Asking questions and asking *good* questions is the most important skill you can learn in school. We'll have many opportunities to practice this over the course of the semester.
- Learn how to learn.  Learning takes practice and involves asking questions (see prior bullet). Being a software engineer involves solving problems on your own, tinkering, making up solutions to things, reading obtuse documentation or playing with an API.
- Learn how to solve problems.  Similar to the last bullet, but I wanted to call it out separately.
- Reading code is just as important as writing it. In my opinion, writing code is *easier* than reading it.  This also means that copying code from Stack Overflow or a blog isn't advised without *understanding* what it does.

There will probably be more to come!
