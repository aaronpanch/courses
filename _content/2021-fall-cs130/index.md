## Introduction

You've probably talked about data structures and algorithms, along with various programming languages and syntaxes, but what else is involved with being a professional engineer? In this class we'll discuss those extra ideas: designing a robust product, writing the software to make it come alive (all the while chasing a moving target) and finally ensuring quality and deployment.

## Class Format

This class is a project-based class. There will be one major project that all members will contribute to for the majority of the semester.  We'll have occasional readings that will help us on our software engineering journey.  As an initial team agreement, we've decided to meet in-person for the semester.

### Goals
As a class, here are some of our goals (myself included!)

- To be better programmers
- To be better communicators
- To deploy a usable web application
- Try out and have familiarity with variety of technologies and tools

### Grading

When working for a company, we're not assigned letter grades; however, since this is a *class* there will be grades.  There isn't a strict specific breakdown, but grades will be determined by the following factors (sorted highest weight to lowest):

1. Project *(Contributions, involvement, engagement)*
2. Participation *(Asking questions, attending class, being a team player)*
3. Readings & Assignments

While there aren't a tremendous number of assignments throughout the semester, each student will have regular 1:1 meetings with me.  At those times, we can check-in on progress, celebrate accomplishments, and discuss where improvements can be made. At any time, students may ask to meet and discuss grades.

### Thanks

Special thanks to Dan Shank for his willingness to share past course content and ideas.
