# Materials

## Books
There is no textbook for this class!  That being said, there will be the occasional reading that may be posted on this website, on canvas, or distributed in hard-copy in class.

## Computers & Software
A laptop is required for this course.  Much of our work will be collaborative and we'll be using our laptops in class.

Any development environment will be ok (Mac, Windows, Linux) but we'll be using software such as Docker, NodeJS, Git, etc.  See me if you have trouble with this requirement.
